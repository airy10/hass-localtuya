"""Which access control datapoints a Tuya lock exposes.

Ported from ha_tuya_ble commit bea2520 ("feat(lock): report who opened the
lock"). Tuya locks share a platform-wide datapoint schema: 0qxp5u7s,
isk2p555 and ludzroix carry the same codes on the same datapoint ids. The
integration already downloads the product specification and keeps it in
``device.function`` and ``device.status_range``, keyed by code and carrying
the datapoint id, so the ids are looked up there rather than tabulated per
product - which also covers locks nobody here can test.
